    <string id="2DpewE0u" text="Якасць крыві заўсёды паказвае сябе. Паглядзіце на Гарыёса і яго нягоднікаў. Гуляюць пад натоўп. Хто такія людзі Рыджыі? Нікчэмнікі. Яна - выскачка ды авантурніца." />
    <string id="3VSBVR8R" text="У кожным разе, Люкан з добрай сям'і, вы не можаце гэтага адмаўляць. Ён ведае нашыя законы і шануе іх, і вы ўпэўнены, што ён будзе прытрымвацца стандартаў." />
    <string id="5BWAsyeB" text="Фартуна ўсміхнулася мне. Я нарадзіўся ў адным з самых багатых дамоў у Кальрадыі. Мой бацька выдаткаваў шмат грошаў на маю адукацыю, каб я змог захаваць гэтае багацце. Першае і найважнейшае, што я даведаўся - просты народ з'яўляецца крыніцай майго багацця, таму я мушу бараніць яго." />
    <string id="5mvtRbb8" text="Мой сын будзе кіраваць, і ён будзе ваяваць са сваімі братамі і васаламі. А пасля яго мае ўнукі будуць ваяваць адзін з адным. Прынамсі, як каралі і прынцы, яны могуць атрымліваць асалоду ад сухіх шатроў, добрага віна і мяккіх пасцеляў ад змяркання да світання. Гэтая ўсё, што мага атрымаць у жыцці." />
    <string id="6Opb3jr0" text="Я багаты чалавек. Я інвестую свае грошы, а потым раблю ўсё патрэбнае, каб гэтыя грошы прыносілі прыбытак. Гэта адказ на вашае пытанне?" />
    <string id="6roMVNMW" text="Але той, хто застаецца тут, на зямлі, заваяванай маім продкам, той жыве пад маёй рукой. Гэта ўсё, што мага сказаць." />
    <string id="7poObaCF" text="Так, ім патрэбны быў дужы гаспадар, як статку жывёлы на горнай сцежцы патрэбны пастух, які ведае сцежку. Статкі ў горах, бачыце... Часам упартыя старыя быкі, якія ідуць сваім шляхам, збіваюцца са сцежкі і вядут іншых да прорвы." />
    <string id="8faAcjLz" text="Эчерыён Тыран-Забойца быў маім продкам. Было б няправільна, калі б я змагаўся за дэмагога-выскачку накшталт Гарыёса або за паўзамежніцу-авантурніцу накшталт Рыджыі, так?" />
    <string id="91wurGIB" text="Мая сям'я? Мяне ўсынавіў фэн Графендок, але насамрэч у мяне няма сям'і. Я быў пасланы Нябёсамі прама ў дарунак баттанійцам. Яны не ведалі гэтага, але ім патрэбны быў дужы кароль." />
    <string id="9f11AsTw" text="Мой народ - гэта людзі з узгоркаў. Тут, наверсе, мы прыглядаем адзін за адным. Вашае жыццё і багацце залежаць ад таго, ці заўважаць вашыя суседзі набег баттанійцаў. Маім людзям падабаецца Гариос. Яны давяраюць яму. Я не збіраюся праліваць іх кроў, ваюючы за некага іншага." />
    <string id="aifXT4E1" text="Мой дзед сапраўды выратаваў баяраў, і з той пары іх няўдзячныя спадчыннікі спрабуюць адмахнуцца ад гэтай клятвы. Яны любяць сварыцца, браць тое, што жадаюць, і не клапоцяцца пра гаспадарства." />
    <string id="aRlW5rks" text="Нябёсы ведаюць, што я любіў Арэнікоса. Я праліваў за яго сваю кроў. Але яго мара пра свет з нашымі суседзямі была фантазіяй. Вы можаце весці вайну на межах або ў сябе дома. Я лічу за лепшае ваяваць на межах. Няхай мужчыны зарабляюць славу, золата і расказваюць казкі сваім унукам." />
    <string id="bFZrLY8W" text="Мой клас вучылі, як кіраваць, і мы мусім кіраваць. Але адзін з нас заўсёды павінен быць вышэйшы за іншых. Збярыце нас у Сенат, як хоча Люкан, і мы заўсёды будзем сварыцца і біцца. Хай імператар або імператрыца кіруюць у сталіцы, і хай іх дзеці змяняюць іх, без усякай мітусні. Мы дамо ім мірную і квітнеючую краіну." />
    <string id="bpSh9rhh" text="Нэрэцы заўсёды трымаліся закону, падтрымвалі парадак і сачылі за тым, каб гаспадарылі лепшыя людзі. Гэтым і я займаюся цяпер." />
    <string id="Cgdg9Q8t" text="Народныя сходы, вядома, мёртвыя. Спакуса перадаць справы ў рукі тырана або ў збор багатых старых занадта непераадольна. Хто хоча мець справу з хаосам і ўпартасцю натоўпу? Гэта ніколі не было лёгка. Але я па-ранейшаму лічу, што адзіны справядлівы спосаб для супольнасці прымаць вынахады - гэта галасаванне ўсіх яго чальцоў." />
    <string id="Cx2FCePF" text="The Senate chooses the Emperor. That is our law. It has been twisted, broken, or ignored for 100 years. But it has never been changed. Without law, without fealty to the written word, there is but tyranny and the mob." />
    <string id="dlaodeKS" text="All men are thieves at heart. I'd rather have one big thief than a thousand little ones. So, I believe in monarchy." />
    <string id="dpYb59BB" text="The Khergit have suffered greatly in the wars of the Khuzaits. So many of our men have fallen..." />
    <string id="eylmGUOE" text="The duty of a sultan is to lead the tribes in war, and to allow them to uphold their honor. It is not to make them love each other, and it is not to make men of honor sit down and pretend to be friends with thieves and scum in the name of 'peace.' That is all I will say." />
    <string id="FSwVVdHV" text="Still, men are willing to fight for me, though it gains them nothing, for no other reason that the throne is my right. I will not betray these men. If I win, in centuries to come, people will think back on my victory and think, 'Heavens smile on those who fight for their rights.' That is all one can do." />
    <string id="gpuxIEBl" text="We are the Banu Sarran. Our lineage is as old as is any of the Aserai. Our forefather Sarran was a grandson of Asera, no less than Qild or Hulyan. . But a hundred years ago we were driven into the desert. Only recently have we returned. The others look down on us for this." />
    <string id="GwvxfXs3" text="But it is wearisome to be a Sultan. The clans cling to their grievances as though they were their children. It is not in men's nature to appreciate the fruits of peace and order. Rather, they brood over small injustices and perceived slights, and dream of shedding blood." />
    <string id="He0b6FpY" text="The boyars swore an oath to my grandfather to obey him as prince. They begged him to save them from the wrath of the Empire, which they had stirred up with their raids and their lawless ways." />
    <string id="jg6SMQLc" text="Our family has always sent its sons to become generals. It has been our privilege to lead the men of the Empire into battle. Without these men, there would be no empire. The great estates of the senators would be blackened ash." />
    <string id="kRRnXYOR" text="Beyond that, I was taught what any aristocrat worthy of his noble name should know and how he should behave. Keep his word. Fight for his country. Have have the grace to listen to the needs of the poor men who work his estate. Have the sense not to take their advice on how to manage it." />
    <string id="kssR76dM" text="I will strive to be a good Empress. I'll do my best. But I know well that whoever wins this civil war, landlords will still cheat tenants, city guards will still demand bribes, warriors will still kill men to steal their cattle, drunken husbands will beat wives. The plague and the labor of childbirth will take more lives than all the evils of man put together. " />
    <string id="l4quU1x3" text="So long as Monchug has a firm hand on things, I do not worry much. The other clans dare not covet our lands and herds too openly. Yes... A strong khan can be a great blessing to the weak, so long as he remains strong." />
    <string id="MoAKmXDv" text="We're of a very old family that has done great service to the Empire. But I'll tell you something - a man, whatever his bloodline, is only as good as his honor and his obediance to the law. " />
    <string id="nQn87o0F" text="Our family have been the masters of this corner of the woods since the gods willed that the trees grow and the rivers flow. Someone wants to call himself Prince of the Sturgians? We have no quarrel with that. Just let that prince know that on our land, we're still the masters." />
    <string id="nz6ff0nw" text="I will break them. By the Heavens I will bring them to heel, or the knife will fall on them." />
    <string id="OFOXDkPv" text="The Empire, before it was an empire, was a Republic. Popular assemblies made the decisions. My family were known for their talents as rhetors. We took it upon ourselves to speak to the popular assemblies, to steer them to reason. It is not easy to get a tumultuous crowd to think in its interests and not follow its passions, but we tried. " />
    <string id="oUKWHMDq" text="Two generations ago, the Sturgian lords entered into a covenant to give their allegiance to a prince. We surrendered our ancient freedoms so that we might be united in war. Was that wise? I have no idea. But I know that if we rupture that convenant now, forging it again would be long and bloody task. Perhaps an impossible one." />
    <string id="PN8hNFek" text="The Banu Hulyan have never sought glory or domination. Where some see an enemy, we see only a trading partner who has gone astray. For that reason, we have tried to treat all others with fairness and respect." />
    <string id="rKKAYQkJ" text="When my great-grandfather Osric Iron-Arm declared himself king of Vlandia, the emperor himself sent us a golden crown as a goodwill gift. Hmf. Do not trust gifts from the Empire." />
    <string id="RyrdJI5j" text="It is for this reason that I lead the clan. The other clans, they think that because the Khergits are led by woman, that we are weak. They look at our land, our wealth, and think - we could take that. I can fight one of them, I can fight two, but I cannot fight them all." />
    <string id="SCogGc7N" text="We are the family of the martyred Emperor. Every man wishes to leave what he has to his children, be it a tiny patch of land or the imperial throne. Everyone in Calradia, rich or poor, grasps this. The universal principle of inheritance, not the obscure laws of the Senate, is what makes an Emperor in the eyes of the people." />
    <string id="spQJxKtr" text="Lucon and Rhagaea will never restore the assemblies. Neither has any faith in the people. Garios, well, he is no democrat, but he has that faith. I will fight for him. Maybe he will bring back the assemblies. No one else will." />
    <string id="Sy7dajDq" text="The wise herdsman, you see, will slaughter the old bulls to prevent the destruction of the entire herd. And I am a wise herdsman." />
    <string id="T1svPL9Z" text="I am the daughter of the Emperor Arenicos. If I were his son, all the Senate would be tripping over their beards and walking sticks to swear allegiance to me. One day I will stand before them as empress, and they will give me their oaths." />
    <string id="uJeoa6u1" text="Senators understand the law. If a man does not understand the law, no matter how much money he has, he cannot enter the senate. I respect our soldiers but they cannot govern. If I win this war, I will reestablish the Senate's authority over the emperor." />
    <string id="uK4IX036" text="The soldiers of the Empire don't ask for much in return. They want an Emperor who will train them hard, fight them hard, and reward them generously. Let them choose the man to do that." />
    <string id="uvd3DYcI" text="I would advise the other clans: Watch what you say about us. We have our pride, and our swords. Do not tempt us." />
    <string id="vzYQuR5r" text="We are the sons of Derngil. Our forefathers came to this land in the ships from the west, in the time of the gods. We have been here a long time. And I tell you, never have we seen a leader like Caladog. A right murderous bloody bastard, a man with no father, some would say, and would I call them a liar? But he holds us together, somehow, and I would stomach a great deal of tyranny for that." />
    <string id="wv2jPN3Q" text="We, the sons of Uvain, were passed over by the High King when it came time to marry their daughter. They chose Caladog. And, well, one might ask... What did that get them? But no matter, no matter. It's all done now. We have all sworn our oaths to Caladog. So let him rule." />
    <string id="yJQLtlXj" text="If you toss a bone into a pack of wild dogs, what does having that bone mean? It means that you get bitten a lot. I have spent most of my life in the saddle or sitting in front of a besieged fortress. Once I thought, 'I suffer, but at least my son will rule in peace.' Such lies we tell ourselves. There will never be peace." />
    <string id="yqn4Wtwr" text="The Arkit are the eldest sons of the great she-wolf who gave birth to the Khuzaits. Properly speaking, Urkhun should have allowed us to lead the great war of conquest. But no matter, that time has passed. We respect the khanate and we respect the banner of the khan. We swore our oaths to Urkhun and we shall keep faith with our oaths, so long as his heirs keep faith as well." />
    <string id="YWQlYXST" text="Unqid is a wise man. He knows how to keep the peace, to soothe over tensions. But there is only so much he can do. We can overlook an insult, or two. But if we overlook too many, perhaps some people will think that we would also overlook an injury. That would be dangerous." />
    <string id="YZyaxSbH" text="Urkhun, my forefather, gave the Khuzaits everything they had. They were as mangy steppe dogs, eating from the scrapheap outside the walls of the cities. He turned them into a pack of wolves. He raised his hand, and cities fell, and he gave the clans land to call their own." />
    <string id="ZIhocjnr" text="For that reason, the clans have always brought their quarrels to us, to adjudicate. And it was natural that, when it came time for the Banu Asera to choose a sultan, that we were the ones chosen." />
    <string id="zR1ONwM8" text="Is there a chieftain of the Khuzaits who does not like my decisions? Is there one who does not want me as khan? So be it - let him abandon his lands, the gift of my forefathers, and flee back into the great grass. I will not follow. I will not hunt him." />
