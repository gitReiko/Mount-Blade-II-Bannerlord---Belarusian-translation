    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader002" text="Last time we talked about the creation myth of the land of sika." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader003" text="Of course, legend says, in the end of the university, there is a place full of chaotic energy, in the ancient times, the great deities,thirsty for such power, start an endless war." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader004" text="Continue" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader005" text="The war almost destoryed the entire world, until the godess of peace's proposal put an end to it. But, the game of power didn't stop, the gods create the races of our world, and a new war in their gods's name soon erupted between them." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader006" text="Continue" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader007" text="No one knows how long does this war last, the only thing we know is the mankind outlast this onslaught and rule the continent." />

    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader011" text="Just when human beings thought that they had stabilized their territory, in the black lands where no one noticed, evil forces pirece the whole continent like arrows." />

    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader028" text="Ha, I guess that means you run for your life! Then why are you coming back?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader029" text="I understand, Then why are you coming back?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader030" text="There's an important letter in my cargo. I must recover it from those bandits." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader031" text="What's your plan?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader032" text="I guess you will have a chance if last night they didn't launch a suprise attack. I have some money left in my pocket. You can recruit some soldiers in the nearby villages, and I know their direction. If you can defeat those bandits, half of my cargo will be yours." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader033" text="I'll try." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader034" text="Of course, let's begin." />

    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader035" text="{PLAYER.NAME}, looks like we now have enough troop to strike them." />

    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader039" text="I know, wait for me." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader040" text="My intel suggest they scattered around the village, we can sneak around them and use suprise element to divide and conquer." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader041" text="Okey." />

    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader042" text="Thank you,{PLAYER.NAME}, here are the cargo I promised you." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader043" text="So, what's next?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader044" text="I think I will sell the remaining cargo in the town." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader045" text="Did you find that letter?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader046" text="Of course, now I must heading to the nearest town and sell the cargo, you will find me in the tavern." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader047" text="Okey." />

    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader048" text="Finally, you come, I thought you were escaped." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader049" text="What happened?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader050" text="What happened? did you know we just attacked the slavers?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader051" text="I know, who are they?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader052" text="And you saved one of their slave? don't you know you are playing with fire? Oh, we are doomed! didn't find out who they are before we act will be our last mistake!" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader053" text="What happened, you look so scared." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader054" text="Yes, the slavers, they control all the slave trade in this land, every kingdom support them! There used to be a king of a small kingdom, who fall in love with a slave, and he asked the slavers to set her free, then, you know what happened?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader055" text="They free her?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader056" text="Of course not you idiot, instead, the slavers conquer that country, every single survivor become slave. All the faction in this continent support these bastards, If I were you I'll free that slave and escape as fast as I can." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader057" text="I won't escape." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader058" text="I have tell you what I must. the slavers won't let us go. Oh, the letter, I think you should take it, I will go to another continent. also here are 2000 dinars, as Compensation, If I know they are the slavers's member, I won't get you involved, farewell." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader059" text="(Take the letter and coins.)" />

    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader060" text="I will leave soon, see you next time." />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader061" text="I want to know who the slavers is?" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader062" text="I know, take care!" />
    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader063" text="Frankly, I don't know who's really behind them either, the only thing I know is the slavers trade slaves all across the continent, no matter war prisoner or debt slave. If you were enslaved by them, you will be a slave for life, and you can only serve the master buy you from the slavers. They will hunt you down if you want to escape or disobey your master. Few can escape from such hunt, maybe they escape to the other continents. Because the slavers reward those who help them generously, and every kingdom's slave trade are count on them. that's all I know about them." />

    <string id="strTalkTradeLeader064" text="If that's all, I think we must go." />

    <string id="strTalkSlaveGirl1412" text="Yes, I got the mark of slave on my hand and neck, that means I am a slave for life, and I must serve a master, or the slavers will hunt me down and sell me to a new master." />

He succeed his father's position as our oracle, other children say he possess the ability as an oracle, but he refuse to show it to others. His father failed to foreseen the attack of the slavers, so nobody believes the oracle after that. But I think he can help Icey." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader006" text="Sally, what's your plan against the slavers?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader007" text="The slavers are powerful, but, I'm sure we have a way to destory them." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader008" text="So, at last we can't escape our fate, I'm sorry master, I shouldn't get you involved…" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader009" text="No, I will try to save you either if I have a second chance. The only difference is I will get well prepared." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader010" text="I shouldn't come to save you if I can foresee the situation, threre's no hope." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader011" text="Master, I think you can try to escape with sally, she will be honored if she can protect master from some arrows, then master will have a better chance to survive, If you managed to escape with sally alive, then the sikans will live on." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader012" text="I hope so, but we are surrounded and outnumbered, I'm afraid I can't make it in such circumstances." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader013" text="I won't escape, because I choose to fight, then I will fight to the very last moment." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader014" text="I can't left you to dead, maybe there's still hope!" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader015" text="No, I will esacpe myself, goodluck!" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader016" text="Ok, I will escape with sally, and I will be back soon." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader017" text="(As soon as you decide, you saw Sally and some of the captives looking up at the hillside in the distance, the ground is shaking, Sally looked back at you and said: Something seems to be coming from over there!)" />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader018" text="My dear master, we, the sikan thank you for saving us. Without you we will surely face a gloom fate. We, the sikans, will be your servant forever." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader019" text="No, without those knights of sika, I'm sure no one can survive this day." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader020" text="Sure, but without you, we will never have a chance to be saved by the knights. I must say we will never forgot your deed and goodness." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader021" text="No, I don't want to enslave you forever, and you took an arrow because of me." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader022" text="No, I'm glade to get hurt if that means master can be safer. I'm an old man, I guess that can be my last bit of value. Now, master, you know who are the Slavers, and the sikans are counting on you." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader023" text="But how can I fight these Slavers? We are too weak." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader024" text="Don't worry master, I got a plan and we won't fail you. we must leave and find a suitable place to build a base for you. The sikans are the first race of the continet, there are still many factions in the continet will protect us. If we eastablish a base, those factions will surely offer their help, and the Slavers will think twice before launching attack. Now, we must hurry, this is not the place to talk. We can discuss it later." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader025" text="My dear master, I, Monnai, want to say 'thanks' to you in the name of the sikans, and we swear we will be your servant, forever." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader026" text="I still don't want you be my slave, I hope I can free you." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader027" text="Then so be it, I will be your new master, and you must stay loyal to me, forever." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader028" text="It's our honor to be your slave, some of us may choose to leave, but the rest will serve you till their very end. With the mark of slave on our flesh, we don't have any choice, we must be someone's slave unless someone can destory the slavers once and for all. And you are a good master." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader029" text="Yes, master, some of us may choose to leave, but the rest will serve you till their very end. " />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader030" text="Understood, now we have a base of operation, so what's next? how can we fight the slavers?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader031" text="Master, we don't have any chance to defeat the slavers if we don't expand our influence and power." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader032" text="So, what should I do?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader033" text="We, the sikan, are protected by numerous factions in the continent since the ancient times. If no one come to protect us this time, then… maybe fall is our unavoidable fate. For now, I suggest we should contact the knights of sika, they can protect us… for now." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader034" text="Where shall I go to find them? ah, yes, I have a letter from them. (you show Monnai the letter from the knights of sika.) " />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader035" text="A letter from the knights of sika? This will surely make things easier, you can find their messager in the nearby tavern. Just told them you are representing Sikans. We will continue the construction while you are searching The knights of sika. You can ask Sally to see what you can do if you want to help the construction work, master." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader036" text="Understood." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader037" text="My dear master, how can I help?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader038" text="Yes, tell me about that ritual, I mean, can you explain Navi's power?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader039" text="Yes, this is the power of the sikan oracles, through the right ritual, they can call on the power of the mother god." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader040" text="You mean that 'Ryenus'? the name Navi called on the ritual?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader041" text="Yes, master, but please don't call her name directly. This is our taoo. The mother god haven't respond to our ritual for a long time, this is truly a miracle, please, keep what just happened a secret. If others know it, I'm afraid other factions will do harm to us." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader042" text="Understand." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader043" text="The mother god have no malicious will to master, or she won't manifest her power. And thank you for helping Icey, looks like you truly improved her condition. She told me she want to thanky you, master, you can pay her a visit." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader044" text="Master, anything I can help?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader045" text="Nothing." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1001" text="Dear master, you are back. Patriarch Lorin has told me the current situation. With Xiang Chuba to protect the village, you can find other power to resist the slaver group with us." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1002" text="Well, I heard that Sika and Cagie have a long history? Can they protect the village?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1003" text="Master, please rest assured that the Cagie people, like us, may not have much shelter in the mainland except you my master. They will protect this village to the death. We have started training, and this time we will fight to protect our homeland." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1004" text="Well, I'm relieved that you said so. So did you know them very early?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1005" text="We have never seen them, but the Cagie have been in contact with us for a long time. In our historical records, it is said that there was once a generation of leaders of the Cagie nationality and our Sika nationality, who became very close friends. Since then, they have been one of the few forces on the mainland that have not been hostile to our Sika nationality." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1006" text="So what happened then?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1007" text="Later, our Sika nationality gradually declined and lost contact with the Cagie nationality. But unlike us, they always guarded their land until the emergence of the slaver group." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1008" text="Did the slaver group destroy them? What happened?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1009" text="It is said on the mainland that about 100 years ago, the king of the Cagie nationality married a slave, which caused the siege of the slaver group. Finally, the forces of the Cagie nationality were annihilated by the slaver group. Since then, few people on the mainland know about them." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1010" text="So Lorin, who are they?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1011" text="They are descendants of the remaining Cagie people who fled after the attack, because there are few remaining people, few people know, and there is no news on the mainland. Until about a few years ago, we got the news that the territory of the Cagie nationality was attacked by the slave group again. This time, it is said that only a few people survived." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1012" text="The slaver group attacked them again. What's the reason this time? Isn't the slave who married to the king already dead for a long time?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1013" text="The attack was too small, and no one explained the specific reason. I asked Lorin, and he said he didn't know why. The specific reason might have to ask the slaver group, but the Sika knight was also interested in them, so I didn't know why." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1014" text="Thank you, I know." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1015" text="Thank you master for saving them, otherwise I'm afraid there will be no Cagie people on this continent. Please believe them, their hatred for the slaver group is only heavier than ours." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1016" text="I see." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1101" text="Dear master, are you ready to go?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1102" text="Yes, I heard from Lorin that you have something else to tell me." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1103" text="Yes, Lorin should have told master that when traveling on the mainland, you must not disclose your identity, the gratitude and resentment with the slaver group, and everything about the Sika and Cagie nationalities." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1104" text="I understand." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1105" text="In addition, when master you go to visit those major forces, you can go to the forest northeast of Terdas to find a witch. It is said that she has the ability to predict the future, and she may be able to help us." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaLeader1106" text="I know." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaSettlementTrader020" text="As you see, since some jerk informed the slavers, the start to hunting me and looks like they won't give up easily. So, I guess I can join you, I can offer my service to you, and If you accept, some of my friend on the slaver's bounty list will join you too." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaSettlementTrader021" text="Glad to hear that, we welcome everyone who want to aid our cause." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaSettlementTrader022" text="I accept, for you can supply my settlement." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaSettlementTrader027" text="Yes, I have never seen such a good village. The sikans arranged a house for me. I delivered the supplies they need. I will help the trade here thereafter. If you need anything, you can also buy it from me. By the way, Sally seems to be looking for you." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian001" text="What's up, son?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian002" text="I am searching for the knights of the sika." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian003" text="(He frown with doubt) Why?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian004" text="I come here in the name of the sikans." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian005" text="I come here with the letter from the knights of the sika." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian006" text="Then Derian the wander will show you the way, but, let's go out and deal with those rats at first, stay with me!" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian007" text="Okey." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian008" text="What we have here? A person with a letter from the knights of sika, and he is also the spokeman and protector of the sikans, interesting." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian009" text="What do you mean?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian010" text="Because I have never heard these two factions seeking help from the same person, at the same time." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian011" text="So, the sikans and the knights of the sika, there are actually no interaction between them?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian012" text="Hmm, looks like you are not a native of this continent, that brings me more question, that means now we got two ancient factions of this continent seeking help from an outsider?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian013" text="Let's make it simple, the sikan is the first race of the continent, They lived here for many centuries before any other races comes here. And the Knights of sika is an knightly order founded after the war of the gods, they claim they are the protector of this continent. You will know more in your journey, now, enough talking, we must find another one and see if he can offer us some help." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian014" text="Okey." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian015" text="Damn! looks like we are too late. someone found here before us." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian016" text="The slavers?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian017" text="Maybe. I didn' expect them act so fast." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian018" text="Because we came here?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian019" text="No need to feel guilty, the slavers have a long rivalry with knights of sika, they are just not our first prority." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian020" text="I think we should search here and see what we can find." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian021" text="Okey." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian022" text="So, have you find anything about what happened?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian023" text="Yes, I found something." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian024" text="So what did you find? has he left? reason?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian025" text="Hmm, looks strange." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian026" text="So, who forced him to leave, what is your opinion?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian027" text="The slavers?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian028" text="An enemy of the knights of sika?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian029" text="Garrsion?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian030" text="Other reasons?" />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian031" text="Possible, but no signs of fighting. maybe there's another reason." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian032" text="I don't think so, no one know who we are, they won't follow our trail here." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian033" text="Agree." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian034" text="Any other clues?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian035" text="He left in a hurry." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian036" text="He left based on a plan." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian037" text="He was forced to leave." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian038" text="There are conflict between the clues, I'm not sure." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian039" text="You observed well and have a good judgement." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian040" text="I don't think this is the full picture." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian041" text="Agree, maybe we missed something." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian042" text="Looks like he was gone, what did he bring out?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian043" text="Something valuable." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian044" text="Some ration." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian045" text="Some important things." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian046" text="Some equipment." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian047" text="Yes, looks like he brought some important files with him." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian048" text="I think he wouldn't bring these items." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian049" text="He probably brought some , but that's not his highest priority." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian050" text="That's all for now, he must left in a hurry, for a reason, he bring something important with him. I found the clue that will lead us to him." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian051" text="Then we must hurry!" />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian052" text="Don't distrub me if you don't have anything important." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian053" text="Okey." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1001" text="I know what you want to ask. If you are willing to hand Lorin over to the Sika knight for protection, I can continue to persuade them to protect your village." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1002" text="It's impossible. I can't give up a person who has sworn allegiance to me." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1003" text="Hahaha, maybe that's why they chose you. (he suddenly looks at you with a dignified expression) but do you really understand the price behind this? Kind without thinking is often more cruel than evil." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1004" text="To be honest, I don't know what I'm going to face, but if I don't try, I can't give them up!" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1005" text="Is it acceptable to think about the evil of weighing the pros and cons! I would rather choose the kindness of dying!" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1006" text="The result is unknown. All the results are shaped by people. We just need to be responsible for our choices." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1007" text="Hahaha, maybe you can really do something that no one can do. Unfortunately, the church's biggest concession is not to be hostile to you for some reasons, but they can't help you again." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1008" text="I'm confused. I heard that Sika Knights protect this continent, including Sikans." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1009" text="Yes, so they support you to establish a stronghold and guard the Sika clan. But it seems that things are not so simple, and they did not explicitly say that they would not help you, but it is obvious that they did not send anyone to come." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1010" text="I see, so what's the grudge between the Cagie and the Sika knight? And what grudges do they have with the slave group." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1011" text="The relationship between the Cagie and the Sika knights is hard to say, but I can assure you that the Sika Knights have absolutely no intention of hurting them, otherwise I will not agree to let them protect Lorin and his people. As for the grievances between the Cagie nationality and the slaver group, people on the mainland have spread, but the vast majority of people do not know the Cagie nationality. You can ask the head of Monnai. It is said that the relationship between the Sika nationality and the Cagie nationality has a long history." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1012" text="I see. I'll ask chief Monnai." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1101" text="Why should we camp here?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1102" text="It's not far from the forest here, and the stronghold of the Elin clan should be near here." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1103" text="So why don't we hurry?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1104" text="The settlement of the Elin clan does not welcome outsiders. If there is no correct way, we will just get lost in this forest." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1105" text="Didn't your teacher tell you how to find the Elin's settlement?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1106" text="Don't worry, since the teacher asked us to come here, she must know that we can find a way to get in." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1107" text="I don't know the meaning of your coming here so far. Except for Sika knight, these weak forces can't help you resist the slaver group at all." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1108" text="So you think I should give Lorin to you?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1109" text="To be honest, I don't know. Maybe your choice is right, but it is difficult to resist the slaver group by these weak forces. Besides, the ailing clan can't help you at all." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1110" text="Why?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1111" text="It is said that they declined in ancient times for some special reasons. Since then, they have been in this forest. Many people on the mainland have no idea of their existence." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1112" text="If so, why did your teacher let me come here?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1113" text="Well... I don't know, but I believe in teachers. There must be a reason why she asked you to come." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1114" text="... I really shouldn't come here." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1115" text="So why are you still here? I remember you are also one of Sika knight. If they refuse to help me, why don't you leave?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1116" text="Foreigner, I was indeed a member of Sika knight, but now I am not. We are wandering knights, just following the creed of Sika knights." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1117" text="Even so, you have no reason to continue to help me by my side." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1118" text="Maybe I'm just curious to see how far you can go. But don't worry, in the doctrine of Sika knight, we won't abandon our teammates. Now let's think about how to find a way to enter the Elin's Settlement." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1119" text="Look at that! Something is approaching." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaKnightDerian1120" text="(there is a horse in the distance. It seems that a man fell on the back of the horse. The horse slowly approached you. Suddenly, the man on the horse fell down. Lotas hurriedly ran to pick her up. You took her into the camp and gave her some water. She recovered some strength and said to you...)" />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage002" text="You are welcome, It's my pleasure to reduce the number of those Slaver scum. Besides, The Knights of sika asked me for help." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage003" text="Knights of sika? (There was a deep frown on his face) Indeed there's no faction dare to attack the Slavers except those knights. Stranger, I must say we won't go with you." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage011" text="Ha, Derian, seems like you even forgot your holy codex after been exiled from you order. Let me help you, Codex of peace, volume CMXXXVII, paragraph CCCXXXIII,'You must respect the free will of the others and never enforce anyone, or you will doom yourself. Your order can't save everyone, or we won't in such condition.{PLAYER.NAME}, If you want to survived in this continet, you muststrengthen your faith (Derian want to talk, but after some hesitation he choose to remain slient.)" />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage017" text="They almost recovered, the sikans are good medic." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage019" text="{PLAYER.NAME}, outsider, I'm interested in why you are dared to attack the Slavers, they are powerful and merciless." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage020" text="They attacked me first." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage021" text="This is an accident. I don't know who they are." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage022" text="Because I want to, those bastard deserve that." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage023" text="I probably know. Monnai and I have talked a little. Then it's my turn, Let me answer your question. I don't believe Sika knights. If Sika knights can protect us, there will be no such fate befall on the sikans and us." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage024" text="Understood." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage025" text="Sure, they also have their reasons. You will know more in the future. So I refused their protection." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage026" text="So what's your plan?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage027" text="Same question for you, stranger, I think this is not the place to talk about that. we'd better talk it in the village hall, with Monnai." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage028" text="Okey." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage029" text="{PLAYER.NAME}, I just reached a consensus with Monnai. If we want to fight the Slavers, then we need power and influence." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage030" text="So, how can you increase your power and influence." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage031" text="HaHa, outsider, not our power and influence, but YOUR power and influence." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage032" text="Help me? But why?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage033" text="Why? you saved us from the Slavers, we will never forgot that. The Slavers are powerful, we must fight together." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage034" text="Got it, then let's put an end to those bastard together." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage035" text="Although this is not what I want, there is no other way now." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage036" text="There are still many people oppressed by the Slavers in this continent. These people is surely willing to help us. As long as we gather the strength of everyone, we have the hope to defeat the Slavers." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage037" text="So, what is our first step." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage038" text="First we must set up our own faction, then we shall make this settlement a stronghold, then we will talk about deal with the slavers." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage039" text="Then we can defeat them?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage040" text="Of course not, but we have already send messagers to every faction we have contact in the continent. the fate of sikan and us will count on you, outlander. So, please, accept our loyalty!" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage041" text="I accept!" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage042" text="Elder Monnai, {PLAYER.NAME}, We need to speed up the construction of village and prepare for defense. We need to find help from anyone they can, but first we need someone to protect this settlement. There is a famous Rogue named Xiang Chu Ba nearby. He is the largest bandit band nearby. The most important thing is that unlike ordinary bandits, he only robs the the rich, and distributes the looted goods and money to those in need. Such behavior attracted many people to join him. If we can find a way to persuade him join our cause, it will be of great help to us. My people heard that now his band is resting near our village. If you want to persuade him, you must defeat him first." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage043" text="OK, I see. Let me deal with him." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage044" text="Come backed so soon? He must be very unconvinced." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage045" text="Yes, what's next? I've let him go. And I told him that he'll have to join us the next time he loses." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage046" text="That's it. prepare yourself. He will come soon." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage047" text="Will he come?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage048" text="Don't worry, he will come as soon as possible. However, he has a large warband under his command. But I have got a plan for that, just follow my arrangement." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage049" text="Can I trust you? defeat a person with such a big warband is not a walk in the park." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage050" text="Well, I've already thought of it. Listen to my arrangement. I've set a trap for him. After the battle started, he won't take your life. After fighting for a while, you can escape." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage051" text="Retreat?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage052" text="Yes, but a fake one, you can lure to our ambush." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage053" text="Then?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage054" text="Remember when you retreat, head to the vally in the far side, we are outnumbered, so we must choose the best advantage point to set our ambush and traps." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage055" text="Understood." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage056" text="The rest is my part. Everything is under control. The bait has been thrown out, we just waiting for him to bite." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage057" text="(a member of the Cagies walks in and says that there is a man who calls himself Xiang Chu Ba outside with a large warband.)" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage058" text="As I expected, it seems that he already knew this place. Remember, don't panic, just follow the plan." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage059" text="I see. I don't want to die too young." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage060" text="Anything I can do for you?" />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage068" text="Hahaha, Xiang, you are still like this. Don't let your brothers lose their lives for nothing." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage069" text="Screw you, it's better to die than to be in the hands of you people!" />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage075" text="What's going on? Why is brother Lorin here." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage076" text="(Lorin looks at you) he saved me from the Slavers. We built a base to fight Slavers. I told him to find you." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage078" text="Well, thank you, brother. But one thing, not with me, but with him. I'll tell you your place in my plan, and then you can arrange the things." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage079" text="No problem! Brother Lorin, don't worry, you can count on me." />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1005" text="This is a long story. Chuba and I have deep blood feuds with the slaver group. Our Cagie people will keep our vows and be loyal to the Lord. Besides the Lord, we can't go anywhere. We will take this place as our own home." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1006" text="I see, so what should we do next? How to resist the power of the slaver group." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1007" text="On the one hand, it is to see whether the Sika knight can provide help (he looks to the side of Derian, but Derian ignores him), on the other hand, we should go to other parts of the mainland to find forces that can help us resist the slaver group. There are many forces resisting the slave group in different places. Let's see if we can form an alliance with them to resist the slaver group." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1008" text="I'll go to see Deri (before you finish speaking, Derian snorted and interrupted you)" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1009" text="(Derian: hum, what forces can there be on this continent? In addition to the Sika knights who can really resist the slaver group, who else is interested in guarding the Sikans. You refuse to go to the Sika church and want to ask for their help. And don't you know that because of your existence, the slaver group will not let go here. I don't know the gratitude and resentment between the slaver group and the Sika family, but the gratitude and resentment between you and them must be known to everyone.)" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1010" text="What grudges do you have with the slaver group?" />

    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1103" text="126 years ago, Lord. Yes, the only Cagie people left after we fled after the destruction of the kingdom. As for the reason, what the lord heard was not true. The queen of the Cagie clan was never a slave." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1104" text="Not a slave? You mean your king didn't marry a slave at that time? So why did the slaver group attack you." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1105" text="We don't know why, but it's clear in our records that the queen led the Cagie people to prosperity at that time. Everything was an excuse made by the slaver group to plunder us." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1106" text="I see. Why did the slaver group attack you again after so many years?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1107" text="I don't know why they attacked us again. If I knew, I would be ready for everything. Not like now." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1108" text="Who are you, including the Sika knight? Their goal seems to be you?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1109" text="I originally wanted to explain to you after the Lord solved the slaver group. I hope you can trust me and my people. I am the current leader of the Cagie nationality, Cagie Holland Isabel Lorin! We Kajie people are determined to be loyal to you, and you will be our forever leader." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1110" text="I think I can only trust you now. So Xiang Chuba is?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1111" text="After last attack, Xiang Chuba and a small number of Cagie people escaped from being captured by the slave group. The Lord can rest assured that we will defend here to the death." />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1112" text="What's our next plan? The Sika Knight doesn't seem to help us?" />
    <string id="strTalkSikaVillageWiseSage1113" text="Monnai patriarch has discussed with me, and Monnai patriarch will try to contact Sika Knight them. Our plan is that the Lord will go to the major forces to find local forces willing to resist the slaver group together. This is a place where the Lord can go to visit the major forces. Please be careful, don't easily expose your identity and purpose. The claws and teeth of the slaver group are all over the continent. In addition, Monnai clan leader seems to have additional plans and Lord, you say." />
